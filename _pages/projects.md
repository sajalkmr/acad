## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### LLM-based Cyber Threat Intelligence System
**Duration:** March 2025 â€“ Present  
**Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, Google Gemini, Llama3, Mistral, Streamlit  
**Repository:** [LLM-network-analysis](https://github.com/sajalkmr/LLM-network-analysis)
- Developed an AI-driven network traffic analysis system using LLMs and ChromaDB, automating detection, classification, and threat mitigation recommendations from PCAP logs
- Implemented a RAG pipeline with LangChain, integrating Google Gemini and locally-run models (Llama3, Mistral) for context-aware threat assessments via semantic search
- Built a Streamlit web interface enabling interactive querying, live AI-driven analysis, and historical result visualization for cybersecurity analysts
- Built a preprocessing and embedding pipeline using PyShark, Pandas, and Sentence Transformers, achieving 75% classification accuracy on real-world malware datasets

### STRbook
**Duration:** May 2024 â€“ Jan 2025  
**Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, JWT, Express.js  
**Repository:** [STRbook](https://github.com/sajalkmr)
- Developed STRbook to digitize student transformation records, replacing traditional physical record books reducing manual data entry using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, for use by college
- Implemented a robust user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to the application for both students and teachers while adhering to best security practices
- Designed RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on student data, ensuring scalability and efficient data management
- Integrated a PostgreSQL database to store student records, optimizing queries for performance and efficiency
- Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, enabling smooth deployment and high system availability, while implementing performance optimizations in the backend system to ensure scalability and operational efficiency for student data

### ordo
**Duration:** Oct. 2024  
**Tech Stack:** Go, Docker SDK, BoltDB, RESTful API  
**Repository:** [ordo](https://github.com/sajalkmr)
- Built a distributed container orchestration system, to manage large-scale applications across clusters, focusing on scalability and fault tolerance
- Implemented a modular architecture with Go interfaces, enabling customizable scheduling algorithms, including a custom-built Enhanced PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) scheduler for optimized resource allocation
- Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for both worker and manager nodes, enabling programmatic control and interaction with the orchestration system via standard HTTP clients
- Migrated from an in-memory datastore to BoltDB for persistent data storage, enhancing data integrity and ensuring reliable system recoverability post-restart

### raftly
**Duration:** Nov. 2024  
**Tech Stack:** Java, Maven  
**Repository:** [raftly](https://github.com/sajalkmr)
- Implemented the fault-tolerant Raft Consensus Algorithm in Java for reliable log replication and leader election across distributed nodes, ensuring high availability and consistency in distributed systems
- Created a state machine to apply commands from replicated logs, ensuring consistent operations across the cluster
- Developed efficient inter-node communication protocols to handle RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) and log entries, enhancing cluster reliability
- Conducted thorough testing to validate algorithm performance under network partitions and node failures
