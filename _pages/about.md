## Hi, I'm Sajal Kumar! 👋

I'm an **Information Science & Engineering** student based in **Bengaluru**, passionate about the inner workings of **distributed systems** and scalable infrastructure. I enjoy exploring topics around **cloud computing**, **DevOps practices**, and building systems that are not just functional, but scalable and resilient. I'm particularly drawn to projects that solve real-world problems through thoughtful infrastructure and system design.


## 🚀 What I'm Working On

My current focus is on developing cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. I'm building an **LLM-based Cyber Threat Intelligence System** that leverages advanced language models and vector databases to automate network traffic analysis and threat detection.

## 💻 Technical Expertise

I'm proficient in programming languages including **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, with hands-on experience in:
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Azure, Ansible
- **Web Development**: React, Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, ChromaDB, Streamlit, LLMs


## 🏆 Recent Achievements

- **All India Rank 6** out of 400,000+ participants in NCAT 2025 (₹50,000 prize)
- **2nd Place** in the international Proggy-Buggy Towel Day Programming Contest 2025 organized by DataArt, New York.
- **200+ problems** solved on competitive programming platforms
- **Two-time hackathon winner** at college level

## 🌟 Beyond Code

As a core member of the **Google Developer Student Club**, I organized technical workshops and supported students in exploring new technologies. Outside of coding, I'm passionate about **Linux ricing** and **customizing Android ROMs**, where I love fine-tuning systems for optimal performance, clean aesthetics, and a highly personalized workflow.
