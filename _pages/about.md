## Hi, I'm Sajal Kumar! 👋

I'm a passionate **Information Science & Engineering** student at CMR Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, with a strong focus on **distributed systems**, **cloud computing**, and **DevOps**. Currently maintaining a CGPA of 8.53/10, I'm driven by the challenge of building scalable, robust systems that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

My current focus is on developing cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. I'm building an **LLM-based Cyber Threat Intelligence System** that leverages advanced language models and vector databases to automate network traffic analysis and threat detection.

## 💻 Technical Expertise

I'm proficient in multiple programming languages including **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, with hands-on experience in:
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Azure, Ansible
- **Web Development**: React, Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, ChromaDB, Streamlit

## 🏆 Recent Achievements

- **All India Rank 6** out of 400,000+ participants in NCAT 2025 (₹50,000 prize)
- **2nd Place** in the international Proggy-Buggy Towel Day Programming Contest 2025
- **200+ problems** solved on competitive programming platforms
- **Two-time hackathon winner** at college level
