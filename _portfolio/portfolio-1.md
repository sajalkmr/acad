- **RAG Pipeline**: Implemented with LangChain for semantic search capabilities
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for real-time analysis and visualization
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 75% classification accuracy on real-world malware datasets

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, ChromaDB, Google Gemini, Llama3, Mistral
- **Data Processing**: PyShark, Pandas, Sentence Transformers
- **Frontend**: Streamlit

## Impact
This system significantly reduces the time required for cybersecurity analysts to identify and respond to threats by automating the analysis process and providing actionable insights through AI-driven recommendations.
